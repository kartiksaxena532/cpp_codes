The `for` loop with `auto` is a C++11 feature that simplifies the iteration over elements in a container, such as an array, vector, or other iterable data structures. It's often referred to as a "range-based for loop."

Here's a general syntax:

```cpp
for (auto variable : container) {
    // code to be executed for each element in the container
}
```

In this loop:

- `auto` is used to automatically deduce the type of the elements in the container, making the code more concise and readable.
- `variable` is a user-defined name that represents the current element being processed in each iteration.
- `container` is the collection or range over which the loop iterates.

For example, if you have a vector of integers:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    for (auto num : numbers) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` vector, and `num` takes on the value of each element in turn. The output would be:

```
1 2 3 4 5
```
