Before starting the topic let me introduce myself. I am a Mobile Developer currently working in Warsaw and spending my free time for interview preparations. I started to prepare for interviews two years ago. At that time I should say I could not solve the two sum problem. Easy problems seemed to me like hard ones so most of the time I had to look at editorials and discuss section. Currently, I have solved ~800 problems and time to time participate in contests. I usually solve 3 problems in a contest and sometimes 4 problems. Ok, lets come back to the topic.

Recently I have concentrated my attention on Dynamic Programming cause its one of the hardest topics in an interview prep. After solving ~140 problems in DP I have noticed that there are few patterns that can be found in different problems. So I did a research on that and find the following topics. I will not give complete ways how to solve problems but these patterns may be helpful in solving DP.
