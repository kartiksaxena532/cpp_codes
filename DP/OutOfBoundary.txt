**Line 1-2:** Class definition for the `Solution` class, which contains the `findPaths` method.

**Line 3-4:** Function signature for the `findPaths` method, which takes in the dimensions of the grid (`m` and `n`), the number of moves (`N`), and the starting position (`x` and `y`).

**Line 5:** Constant `M` is defined to be 1000000000 + 7. It's often used as a modulus value in modulo arithmetic.

**Line 6-7:** A 2D vector `dp` of size `m x n` is created and initialized with zeros. This vector is used to store the number of ways to reach each cell.

**Line 8:** The starting position `(x, y)` is set to 1, indicating that there is one way to reach this cell.

**Line 9:** `count` is initialized to 0. It will be used to keep track of the total number of paths.

**Line 11-26:** This is the main loop that iterates over the number of moves (`N`).

**Line 12-27:** Inside the loop, a new 2D vector `temp` is created to store the updated counts for each cell after the current move.

**Line 13-26:** Nested loops iterate over each cell in the grid.

**Line 14-17:** If the current cell is on the border of the grid, update the `count` by adding the count of paths from the current cell.

**Line 18-23:** Calculate the updated count for the current cell based on the counts of paths from neighboring cells.

**Line 24-25:** Perform modulo operation to prevent overflow and assign the updated count to the `temp` vector.

**Line 27:** Update the `dp` vector with the counts from the `temp` vector.

**Line 29-31:** The final count is returned, representing the total number of paths to move out of the grid within the given number of moves.

This code uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the number of paths. The `dp` vector is updated iteratively based on the counts from previous moves. The `count` variable keeps track of the total number of paths considering the conditions mentioned.
